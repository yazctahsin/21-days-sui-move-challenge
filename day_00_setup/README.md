# Day 0: Setup & Getting Started

Welcome to the 21-Day Sui Move Challenge! Before you start coding, let's set up your development environment.

## What You'll Set Up

- ✅ Sui CLI (command-line tool)
- ✅ Code editor (VS Code recommended)
- ✅ Terminal basics
- ✅ Your first build and test

**Time needed:** 20-30 minutes

---

## Step 1: Install Sui CLI

The Sui CLI is the main tool you'll use to build and test Move code.

### Recommended Method: Using suiup (All Platforms)

**suiup** is the official Sui installer and version manager. It works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (via WSL).

#### Step 1.1: Install suiup

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mystenlabs/suiup/main/install.sh | sh
```

This downloads and installs the `suiup` tool.

#### Step 1.2: Install Sui CLI

After suiup is installed, run:

```bash
suiup install sui@testnet
```

**Note:** This installs Sui for testnet. If you need a different version, check the [suiup repository](https://github.com/MystenLabs/suiup).

### Windows-Specific Instructions

**Windows users:** First install WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux):

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Run: `wsl --install`
3. Restart your computer
4. Open Ubuntu from Start menu
5. Follow the suiup installation steps above in Ubuntu terminal

### NixOS-Specific Instructions

**NixOS users:** Instead of using suiup, you can use the `flake.nix` shipped with this repository.

Easiest way to use the flake is running the command `nix develop`.

### Verify Installation

After installation, verify it worked:

```bash
sui --version
```

You should see something like: `sui 1.x.x-testnet`

### Troubleshooting

**"command not found" error?**

The Sui binaries directory might not be in your PATH. Try:

```bash
# Reload your shell configuration
source ~/.bashrc   # For bash
# or
source ~/.zshrc    # For zsh

# Then try again
sui --version
```

**Still not working?**
1. Close and reopen your terminal completely
2. Check if suiup installed correctly: `which suiup`
3. See detailed troubleshooting: [Sui Installation Docs](https://docs.sui.io/build/install)

### Alternative: Manual Installation (Advanced)

If suiup doesn't work, you can install via cargo:

```bash
# Install Rust first
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env

# Install Sui CLI
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git --branch testnet sui
```

**Note:** This method takes 10-15 minutes and requires more disk space.

## Step 2: Install VS Code (Code Editor)

VS Code is a free code editor that works great with Move.

### Download & Install

1. Go to: https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Download for your operating system
3. Install and open VS Code

### Install Move Extension

1. Open VS Code
2. Click the Extensions icon (4 squares) on the left sidebar
3. Search for "Move"
4. Install the "Move" extension by Mysten Labs

**Benefits:**
- Syntax highlighting (colors for code)
- Auto-completion
- Error detection

---

## Step 3: Understanding Terminal Basics

The terminal (also called command line) is where you'll run commands.

### Opening Terminal

**macOS:**
- Press `Cmd + Space`
- Type "Terminal"
- Press Enter

**Linux:**
- Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`

**Windows (WSL):**
- Open "Ubuntu" from Start menu

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Show current directory
pwd

# List files in current directory
ls

# Change directory
cd folder_name

# Go to parent directory
cd ..

# Go to home directory
cd ~
```

### Practice

Try these commands:
```bash
# Navigate to your Desktop
cd ~/Desktop

# See where you are
pwd

# List files
ls
```

---

## Step 4: Clone or Download This Project

### Option A: Using Git (Recommended)

If you have Git installed:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
git clone [repository-url]
cd 21Challenge
```

### Option B: Download ZIP

1. Download the project as ZIP
2. Extract to your Desktop
3. Open Terminal and navigate:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Desktop/21Challenge
   ```

---

## Step 5: Your First Build & Test

Let's make sure everything works!

### Navigate to Day 1

```bash
cd day_01
```

**Understanding this command:**
- `cd` = change directory (move to a folder)
- `day_01` = the folder name

### Build the Code

```bash
sui move build
```

**What this does:** Compiles (translates) your Move code into a format Sui can understand.

**Expected output:**
```
BUILDING day_01
Build successful
```

> **You may see warnings — this is normal!** Warnings like `unused function` or `unused variable` are NOT errors. As long as you see `Build successful` at the end, your code is correct. These warnings will disappear as you use the functions in later days.

> **Windows users:** If the build fails, try deleting the `Move.lock` file and rebuilding:
> ```bash
> rm Move.lock
> sui move build
> ```
> This is a known Windows-specific issue. See TROUBLESHOOTING.md for details.

**If you see errors:** Check TROUBLESHOOTING.md in the project root.

### Run Tests

```bash
sui move test
```

**What this does:** Runs all test functions to verify code works correctly.

**Expected output:**
```
Running Move unit tests
Test result: OK. Total tests: 0; passed: 0; failed: 0
```

> **You may see warnings — this is normal!** You may also see warnings when running tests. If the tests pass (shows `OK`), your code is working correctly.

**Note:** Day 1 has no tests yet, that's normal!

---

## Step 6: Open Project in VS Code

### Open from Terminal

While in the `21Challenge` folder:

```bash
code .
```

**Note:** The `.` means "current directory"

### Or Open Manually

1. Open VS Code
2. Click "File" → "Open Folder"
3. Navigate to `21Challenge`
4. Click "Open"

### Explore the Structure

In VS Code's sidebar, you'll see:
```
21Challenge/
├── README.md
├── day_01/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── Move.toml
│   └── sources/
│       └── main.move
├── day_02/
...
```

---

## Step 7: Understanding the Workflow

For each day, you'll follow this pattern:

### 1. Navigate to the Day's Folder

```bash
cd day_01
```

### 2. Read the README

```bash
cat README.md
```

Or open it in VS Code.

### 3. Open the Code File

Open `sources/main.move` in VS Code.

### 4. Complete the TODOs

Look for comments like:
```move
// TODO: Your task here
```

### 5. Build After Changes

```bash
sui move build
```

**Fix any errors** before moving to the next step.

### 6. Run Tests

```bash
sui move test
```

All tests should pass ✅

### 7. Commit Your Work

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Day 1: completed"
```

## Common Questions

### Q: Which terminal should I use?

**macOS/Linux:** Built-in Terminal is perfect
**Windows:** WSL Ubuntu terminal (after installing WSL)

### Q: Do I need to know Rust?

**No!** Move has some similarities to Rust, but you'll learn Move from scratch.

### Q: Can I use a different editor?

**Yes!** VS Code is recommended, but you can use:
- Vim/Neovim with Move plugins
- Any text editor (but no syntax highlighting)

### Q: How much time per day?

Plan for **1-2 hours per day**:
- 15-30 min reading
- 30-60 min coding
- 5-10 min testing

### Q: Can I skip days?

**Not recommended!** Each day builds on previous days. If you skip, you'll miss important concepts.

### Q: What if I get stuck?

1. Re-read the day's README
2. Check TROUBLESHOOTING.md
3. Look at `sources/solution.move` (but try first!)
4. Check Move Book links provided
